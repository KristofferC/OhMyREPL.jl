A package that hooks into the Julia REPL and gives it syntax highlighting, bracket highlighting, rainbow brackets and other goodies.
A (slightly outdated) video showing installation and features of the package is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTLPAOLLbTU).

If you like this package please give it a star. I like stars.

### Installation

```jl
Pkg.add("OhMyREPL")
```

and then just load with `using OhMyREPL` (preferably by putting it in the `.julia/config/startup.jl` file)

### Features

* Syntax highlighting - Highlighting of keyword, operators, symbols, strings etc. in different colors.
* Bracket highlighting - Will make matching brackets highlighted when the cursor is between an opening and closing bracket.
* Automatic bracket insertion - Will insert matching closing bracket and quotation symbols when suitable.
* Prompt changing - Can change the text and color of the `julia>` prompt as well as add a prompt for output.
* Rainbow brackets - Colorizes matching brackets in the same color.

### Documentation

Please see [the documentation](https://KristofferC.github.io/OhMyREPL.jl/latest) for more extensive description of the features and their settings like how to change coloschemes, how to create your own colorschemes etc.
