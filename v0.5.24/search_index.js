Hitting Enter will recall the currently selected line. The TAB key can be used to instead toggle selection of individual history entries, in which case only selected entries are recalled (in the order they were selected, which is not necessarily their original order in the history). Hitting TAB multiple times (or holding it) will select consecutive entries in the history, and Shift+TAB does the same but in reverse order.","category":"page"},{"location":"features/fzf/","page":"Fuzzy REPL history search","title":"Fuzzy REPL history search","text":"Mouse scrolling is supported, as is click to select an individual line.
